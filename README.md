 <p><b>Known issues:</b></p>
 <ul>
     <li>The font type for the win counter is set to default because the font type I’m using is not to good,<br>
     there is to much space between lines so in landscape mode the win counter text can move out of the screen.</li>
     <li>In smaller screens, the win counter can disappear behind the circles.</li>
     <li>In landscape mod the feedback message can be to small.</li>
     <li>Because the snich color is yellow, sometimes it can be hard to see it on the screen.<br>
     I can’t find a perfect background to solve the issue.</li>
